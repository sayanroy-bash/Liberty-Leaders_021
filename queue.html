            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>
              A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science
              used for storing and managing data in a specific order. It follows
              the principle of 'First In, First Out' (FIFO), where the first
              element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues
              are commonly used in various algorithms and applications for their
              simplicity and efficiency in managing data flow.
            </p>
            <h3>WHAT IS QUEUE IN DATA STRUCTURES?</h3>
            <p>
              A queue is a linear data structure that follows the
              First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It operates like a line where
              elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end
              (front). The first element added to the queue is the first one to be
              removed.
            </p>
            <h3>BASIC OPERATIONS OF QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE?</h3>
            <p>
              Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element to the rear of the queue. Dequeue
              (Delete): Removes and returns the element from the front of the
              queue. Peek (Front): Returns the element at the front of the queue
              without removing it. isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty. Size:
              Checks the number of elements in the queue.
            </p>
            <h3>PROPERTIES OF QUEUE</h3>
            <p>
              Order: Queues maintain the order of elements based on the FIFO
              principle. Dynamic Size: The size of the queue can change
              dynamically as elements are added or removed. Access: Elements can
              be added at the rear and removed from the front of the queue.
            </p>
            <h3>APPLICATIONS OF QUEUE</h3>
            <p>
              Task Scheduling: Used in operating systems for managing tasks and
              processes. Data Transfer: Utilized in network communication
              protocols to manage data packets. Simulation: Simulates real-world
              systems like waiting lines and customer service. Breadth-First
              Search (BFS): Implements BFS algorithm for graph traversal. Print
              Spooling: Manages print jobs in a printer queue.
            </p>
            <h3>ADVANTAGES OF USING QUEUE</h3>
            <p>
              Order Preservation: Maintains the order of elements, ensuring
              first-come, first-served processing. Efficiency: Provides efficient
              handling of data in real-time systems and applications. Simplicity:
              Simple to implement and use for managing data with FIFO order.
            </p>
            <h3>DISADVANTAGES OF USING QUEUE</h3>
            <p>
              Limited Access: Can only access the front and rear elements, making
              random access difficult. Fixed Size (in some implementations):
              Static queues have a fixed size, which can be limiting if not
              managed properly.
            </p>
            <h3>QUEUE VARIATIONS</h3>
            <p>
              Double-Ended Queue (Deque): Allows insertion and deletion from both
              ends. Circular Queue: A queue implementation where the last position
              is connected back to the first position, forming a circle. Priority
              Queue: Elements are dequeued based on priority rather than the order
              of insertion.
            </p>
            <h3>REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES OF QUEUES</h3>
            <p>
              Customer Service: Managing customers in a service line or call
              center. Printer Queue: Handling multiple print jobs sent to a
              printer. CPU Scheduling: Managing processes in an operating system.
              Network Buffers: Storing data packets in routers and switches.
              Message Queuing: Managing messages between distributed systems and
              applications.
