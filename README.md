## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Stylesheets for visual styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the visualizations.

### Usage

For the Algorithm Visualizer project, the primary technologies used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the foundational structure, styling, and interactivity of the visualizations. These are complemented by Bootstrap for responsive design, D3.js for data-driven manipulation of visuals, and Animate.css for adding dynamic animations.
